# Example SSH config for host aliases used by LetsRenew
# Place this file (or a configured variant) at /home/letsrenew/.ssh/config in the container
# or mount the containing directory from the host into the container.

# Example host alias. Replace HostName and IdentityFile with your values.
Host web.example.com
  HostName 203.0.113.10
  User deploy
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  # Accept new host keys automatically on first connect (safer than no checking)
  StrictHostKeyChecking accept-new
  UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  ServerAliveInterval 60

# Example for a bastion/jump host
# Host bastion
#   HostName bastion.example.com
#   User deploy
#   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bastion
#   Port 22
#
# Host internal-host
#   HostName internal.example.local
#   User deploy
#   ProxyJump bastion
#   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_internal

# Notes for operators:
# - If this config references IdentityFile paths, ensure the referenced private key files
#   are mounted into the container at the same paths (for example mount host ~/.ssh into
#   container /home/letsrenew/.ssh) and have correct permissions (600).
# - Do not commit private keys. Only commit config.example as a template.
